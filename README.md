# MASTERMIND

This is a mastermind game played on terminal. You can guess the computer's random code or you can be the code maker and set a secret code for computer to guess.

The game will throw a feedback after each guess. Green circle means "correct color in correct position", red circle means "correct color in wrong position". It won't give you any circle if you don't have a correct color.
